Write a Java code that would represent Distance object (meters, centimetres) using classes. 
The class definition include a parameterized constructor, void display ( ) to display the instance variables, void sum(Distance, Distance) to add two distances. 
Now write a main function that creates a couple of Distance objects and demonstrates the addition of two distances.
