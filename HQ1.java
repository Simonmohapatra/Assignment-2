/* 
A sales person is paid commission based on the sales he makes as shown
by the following table:
SALES                        COMMISSION
Under Rs. 100                2% of SALES
Rs 500 and under Rs 5000     5% of Sales
Rs 5000 and above            8% of sales
Write a class, Commission, which has:
An instance variable, sales; an appropriate constructor; and a method,getCommission() that returns the commission.
Now write a Demo class in Java to test the Commission class by reading a sale from the user, 
using it to create a Commission object after validating that the value is not negative. 
Finally, call the getcommission() method to get and print the commission.
If the sales are negative, your Demo class should print the message “Invalid Input”
