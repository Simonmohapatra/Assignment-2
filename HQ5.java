/*
A point in the x-y plane is represented by its x-coordinate and ycoordinate. 
Design a class, PointType in Java, that can store and process a point in the x-y plane. 
You should then perform operations on the point, such as showing the point, setting the coordinates of the point, 
printing the coordinates of the point, returning the x-coordinate, and returning the y- coordinate. Every circle has a centre and a radius.
Given the radius, we can determine the circleâ€™s area and circumference.
Given the centre, we can determine its position in the x-y plane. 
The centre of a circle is a point in the x-y plane. 
Design a class, CircleType that can store the radius and centre of the circle. 
Because the center is a point in the x-y plane and you designed the class to capture the properties of a point from PointType class. 
You must derive the class CircleType from the class PointType. 
You should be able to perform the usual operations on a circle, such as setting the radius, printing the
radius, calculating and printing the area and circumference, and carrying out the usual operations on the center.
